Current structure is that fragments are stored directly as children on a play.
What if we stored fragments as a flat, ordered list, and the plays were just
references to particular indices?

This would allow for free-floating plays like a stolen base or wild pitch, which
aren't associated with a particular at-bat.

Would also potentially make it easier to clean up the tests, which I've been
neglecting.
