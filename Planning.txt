Minimum viable feature: I want an interactive base diagram where I can enter
anything I'd usually put into a box on the score card. I couldn't think of a
good thing to call the box itself in the code, so I settled on PlateAppearance
(though it's really the plate-appearance plus baserunning).

When I click on a base line, I should get a list of options for what gets
recorded there. This could be a modal dialog, but on mobile I'm really liking
the idea of a gesture-based interface. (Perhaps a mode that's specific to
entering the current inning, and a separate mode for viewing the whole card).

Click 1st-base line
* Hit/walk/error/HBP: fill line to first
* Out: select defenders from a diagram, or use keyboard
