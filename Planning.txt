Now play alternates between the home and away team, which isn't super obvious
from the UI except the small "away" or "home" at the top of the page.

What I need is a cleaner separation between the selectors that operate only on
the *current* inning, which I need to add new data, and those that are used for
displaying the card. Perhaps in this way the home/away alternation can be
handled implicitly in a selector, and the store only needs to know which card
we're displaying.

TODO: some kind of transition effect when swapping sides?


Stories remaining before completion
* I can load lineups from today's MLB games into my scorecard
  * Stats are loaded for each player
  * Those stats are updated to reflect new data
* I can record substitutions as they happen in game
  * I can track who's pitching in a game with a DH
* When the game is over, no more data can be added.
* I can view pitcher statistics (difficulty: with DH, pitcher substitutions are
  separate)
* I can export my card, possibly as a PDF?

* Fit and finish
