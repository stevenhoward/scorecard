Now play alternates between the home and away team, which isn't super obvious
from the UI except the small "away" or "home" at the top of the page.

What I need is a cleaner separation between the selectors that operate only on
the *current* inning, which I need to add new data, and those that are used for
displaying the card. Perhaps in this way the home/away alternation can be
handled implicitly in a selector, and the store only needs to know which card
we're displaying.

TODO: some kind of transition effect when swapping sides?
TODO: Render "{top/bottom} of the {inning}, {outs} outs" at the top of the page.
