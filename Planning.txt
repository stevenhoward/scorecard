Currently all PlayFragments are grouped under their corresponding Play objects,
but for stolen bases, caught stealing, and what have you, they need to be stored
independently of the plate appearance data. Otherwise we wind up with an edge
case where stealing home credits the batter with an RBI, e.g.

Should account for the number of outs in the play selector. Can't have a
sacrifice with 2 outs, e.g.

There are some cases where we can do the "smart" thing and don't yet, like for a
fielder's choice play with only one runner on, or a sacrifice fly (which by
definition scores a runner from third).

Should add statistics at the bottom of each inning.
