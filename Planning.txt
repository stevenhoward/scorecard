RBIs are still broken, and I may need some rearchitecting. I need a way to
correlate "advanced by batter X" with its Play object and everything else on the
bases (e.g. SB, WP, PB) needs to stand on its own.

TODO: some kind of transition effect when swapping sides?


Stories remaining before completion
* I can load lineups from today's MLB games into my scorecard
  * Stats are loaded for each player
  * Those stats are updated to reflect new data
* I can record substitutions as they happen in game
  * I can track who's pitching in a game with a DH
* When the game is over, no more data can be added.
* I can view pitcher statistics (difficulty: with DH, pitcher substitutions are
  separate)
* I can export my card, possibly as a PDF?

* Fit and finish
